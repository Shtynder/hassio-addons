# MQTT S7 Connector - Home Assistant Addon

_MQTT Siemens S7 connector to integrate Siemens PLC's with Home Assistant_

This project integrates [mqtt-s7connector developed by Tim Roemisch](https://github.com/timroemisch/mqtt-s7-connector) as an add-on for Home Assistant.

The [DOCS.md](./DOCS.md) file will contain everything you need to know to make the addon work with your Home Assistant installation and your Siemens PLC.

## TODO

- [x] add additional log levels to mqtt-s7-connector
- [x] add multi PLC connection support
- [x] config file and documentation json > yaml (yaml is easier then json)
- [ ] rename object `devices` to `enities` (we are creating entities here not devices, **this will be a breaking update!**)
- [ ] test and document support for Siemens LOGO! with tsap_id's [it should work](https://github.com/plcpeople/nodeS7/issues/37)
- [ ] add screenshots and documentation for configuration in TIA portal, STEP 7 and LOGO!Soft
- [ ] add more Home Assistant [entities](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity)
- [ ] code cleanup

Pull requests welcome!
