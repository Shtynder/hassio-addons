# Home Assistant Add-on: Example add-on

## Configuration

After installing the Addon and the initial run a folder is created, the `\addon_configs\xxxxxxxx_ha-mbmd` folder. Inside this folder you'll find the [`mbmd.dist.yaml`](https://github.com/volkszaehler/mbmd/blob/master/mbmd.dist.yaml) file. This file contains an example of an configuration. Copy the file and rename it to `mbmd.yaml` as a starting point. 

There are several ways to get access to this folder and file, e.g.:

- Samba share add-on
- File editor add-on
- Visual Studio server add-on

Please reffer to  https://github.com/volkszaehler/mbmd/ for more information about the configuration options.
